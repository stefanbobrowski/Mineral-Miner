# ðŸ’Ž Mineral Miner

A Starcraft II tribute game. Built with React.

- Mine Minerals from patches that never run out.
- Use Minerals to hire more Workers. No Worker limit.
- See how many Workers you can hire, and Minerals you can mine, before your browser explodes!

Special thanks to Blizzard for making Starcraft II, and Microsoft for the future Starcraft III.
